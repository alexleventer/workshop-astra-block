### Acknowledgements

This application has been built based on the work of [**Java Brains**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYt1sfh5464XaDBH0oH_o7Q), a famous youtuber *(500k+ subscribers)*. On his channel you can find the full [*Code with me Series*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxVGFBRpEFM), 16 episodes for building this application step-by-step. The link to each episode is provided at the end of this readme.

## 1. Database Initialization

### 1.1 - Create an Astra Account

> **Note**: **Datastax Astra** is a cloud-native, fully managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS) based on Apache Cassandra. It provides a scalable, performant and highly available database solution without the operational overhead of managing Cassandra clusters. Astra supports both SQL and NoSQL APIs, and includes features like backup and restore, monitoring and alerting, and access control. It enables developers to focus on application development while the database infrastructure is managed by Datastax.

- `‚úÖ 1.1.a` - Access [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com) and register with `Google` or `Github` account

### 1.2 - Create an Astra Token

- `‚úÖ 1.2.a` Locate `Settings` (#1) in the menu on the left, then `Token Management` (#2) 

- `‚úÖ 1.2.b`Select the role `Organization Administrator` before clicking `[Generate Token]`
